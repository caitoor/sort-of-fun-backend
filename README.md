# Sort-of-Fun Backend

_A REST API service for a modern board game collection and recommendation system_

## About the Project
The backend of **Sort-of-Fun** is built with Node.js and Express.js and serves as the API for managing board game data. It fetches game data from BoardGameGeek, stores and caches it in MongoDB Atlas, and provides endpoints for filtering, sorting, and scoring games based on criteria like player count, complexity, and playtime. Future enhancements include user ratings, play flags, age recommendations, and social features.
